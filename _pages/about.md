I'm a third year PhD student from [School of IMP](https://imp.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). My research interest includes laser-driven nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, nuclear isomers, and cosmology.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Changbo Fu](https://imp.fudan.edu.cn/b4/d2/c10030a177362/page.htm) of Key Laboratory of Nuclear Physics and Ion Beam Applications from [School of IMP](https://aibp.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University.
